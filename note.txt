A note on decryptor and queryer:

pycryptodome only outputs (and takes as input) bytes/bytearrays which cannot be sent over json so I made it into a hex string. 
(_bytes_.hex() converts _bytes_ of type bytes into a hexadecimal string and bytes.fromhex(_string_) converts the hexadecimal string _string_ into bytes


Also idk what should the mac-check fail signal be. Like throw a 400 bad request or just not do anything and let the return be a 500 server error. or send back a nice message saying "mac check failed"


the key is just copy-pasted to be the same across decryptor and queryer


if queryer doesn't work just dump this in the url:
{'nonce': '457ae640d0e9320354e200', 'header': '686561646572', 'ciphertext': '11470f3fb54a', 'tag': '9fe5445c2d0e5f169a2985e1fcb347c6'}
